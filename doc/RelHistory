Suggestions

Num vFix Description
~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

003 1.01 (doc) Hint: how to scale sprites
004      Should have Impulse support to allow remote control
005 1.07 Compiler should be command line drivable (see below)
006 1.07 Don't show eval box if register=EP:Acorn Documents {SKLC}
007 1.09 Simple extension to data_open response to allow tag selection

Notes to suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
001: New parameter to picture command makes pictures saveable. The picture
     can then be saved from the menu or by dragging the picture itself out
     of the document. Also topic text?
002: Box command can do like pictures and start at the next point where the
     margin status etc is appropriate. It could be illegal to include
     pictures/tabs inside boxes (perhaps not nec??). Boxes should be
     able to have a background which could be a specified colour or
     could be a sprite/draw file (scaled to fit in).
004: This would allow use as an on-line, context sensitive, interactive
     manual. Suggested commands include:
       Open <pathname>               Open file (unless already open)
       Load <pathname>               Open file but not window
       Topic <topicname>             Display particular topic
       Ref <tag>                     Display particular reference
       Index                         Display Index
       Window <x>,<y>,<wid>,<hgt>    Open window at position (OS coords)
       Close                         Close window
       Help                          Open own helpfile
       Quit                          Terminate
       Print                         Print current topic
       PrintAll                      Print current file
       Mark <markname>               Create bookmark
       Findmark <markname>           Display bookmark
       Next                          Display next topic
       Previous                      Display previous topic
       Search                        Open search dialogue
005: Run the !RunImage directly giving input and output files as params
     (eg */!RunImage TextFile HelpFile). The owner string must be in
     the same directory as the !RunImage to allow compilation. The
     wimpslot must be big enough. Errors will be printed and a value
     returned (in Sys$ReturnCode). Input parameters are NOT GSTransed.
007: The DATAOPEN message can have the file name followed by a space and
     a set of parameters. The form is then:
        filename provider,tag[,x0,y0,x1,y1]
     The file will be loaded if necessary, the window popped to the
     front and the specified tag displayed (case sensitive). If x0,y0,x1,y1
     are given they specify the location of the window on the screen. If
     x1<x0 then the position is optional and will only be used to create
     a new window, not if it is already open. The provider is a string
     identifying the source of the message and will be used for a window
     title instead of the filename. For the whole thing to work, this must
     have a validation code on the end (as per the owner string) which will
     be removed prior to display. This means that only licensed software
     can use this facility.
