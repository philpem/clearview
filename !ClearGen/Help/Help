{F:1}{topic:How To Use} The {Picture:i,cvlogo} Software{F:0}{Rule:0}{Picture:R,Logo}
{Picture:i,cvlogo} is a document reader for hyper-linked documents. You can read the text in this window using the scroll bar to the right and the tools in the toolbox at the top of the window. If you do not know how to use the scroll bar, please use your RISC OS user guide to become more familiar with RISC OS before proceeding.

Text presented using {Picture:i,cvlogo} may be read in the normal way (ie from start to finish) as you might expect. The concept of hyper-linking extends this to allow the text to be read in a way more compatible with the way you think.

{Index:Cross References}A hyper-link is a cross reference to another point in the text where there is further relevant information. These cross references are indicated in the text by underlined words and you may click on any such words to follow the cross references. Try this now by clicking {Ref:here,Trial Point}.

Notice that whenever the pointer is over a cross reference it changes to a symbol like this: {Picture:I,pointer}. This serves as an extra reminder and also helps identify the exact area where you may click to follow a cross reference.

As well as following cross references you may use the {Ref:toolbox,Toolbox Commands} and the program {Ref:menu,Main Menu} to help with reading the text.

You may change the size of the window to make more text visible. If you change the width, the text will be reformatted appropriately. There is a minimum limit to the width of each document, generally relating to the size of pictures used.

{Picture:L,File}{Index:Loading}New {picture:i,cvlogo} document files may be loaded by dragging them onto the application or by double clicking them. Note that only one document may be loaded at a time but you may run several copies of the software simultaneously if you really need to view two documents at once. You can recognise {picture:i,cvlogo} document files by their icons which look like the illustration on the left  (If you use small icons in your filer windows, they will look like this: {Picture:I,smallfile}). {Index:Creating Documents}If you have a {Ref:type A (advanced) version,Versions} of this software, you may drag text files to the application to compile and load them.

Your use of this software is governed by the terms of the {Ref:licence,Licences} under which you are using it. Please be sure that you are complying with the terms of the licence before proceeding.

{topic:Toolbox Commands}{F:0}{Rule:0}{Picture:R,Logo}
The toolbox is shown at the top of the window and contains six icons. Clicking on these gives quick access to useful functions when reading a document. The icons perform the following functions:

{Picture:I,forward}{Index:Forward}{>:12}Forward. This icon moves to the next topic in the order in which the topics are stored in the document. This icon will be grey if you are on the last topic in a document. This command will give access to all topics in the document.
{Picture:I,backward}{Index:Backward}{>:12}Backward. This icon moves to the previous topic in the order in which the topics are stored in the document. This icon will be grey if you are on the first topic in a document. This command will give access to all topics in the document.
{Picture:I,trace}{Index:Back Trace}{>:12}Back Trace. This icon allows you to retrace any movements in the document (except those due to scrolling). This is particularly useful if you have been following cross references and wish to return to the main piece of text at the point where you left it. A large but limited number of movements will be remembered.
{Picture:I,find}{Index:Search}{>:12}Search. This icon opens a dialogue box which allows the text to be searched for index points or for particular words. Click {Ref:here,Searching} for more information about this function.
{Picture:I,mark}{Index:Bookmark}{>:12}Bookmark. This icon opens a dialogue box which allows bookmarks to be placed in the text and to be located.  Click {Ref:here,Bookmarks} for more information about this function.
{Picture:I,index}{Index:Index Icon}{>:12}Index. This icon takes you straight to the index page for the document. While the index page is displayed, the button will be depressed in the toolbox as a reminder.

These functions are all duplicated in the Tools sub-menu of the main program {Ref:menu,Main Menu}.

The main menu is displayed by clicking the {B:MENU} button when the mouse pointer is over the main window. This menu has three options:

{F:2}Save{F:0}{Index:Saving}
The Save option leads to a standard RISC OS save dialogue box which allows the current document to be saved. Do this by typing in the full path name and pressing {B:Return} or by entering a file name and dragging the file icon to a directory viewer. This will save the document along with any bookmarks that may have been placed in the text.

{F:2}Print{F:0}{Index:Printing}
The Print option leads to a dialogue box which shows the name of the currently installed printer driver, if any. If there is no printer driver installed, you will not be able to print. Refer to your RISC OS user guide for more information on printer drivers. Click on the {B:Print} icon to start the printout. If the option for 'This topic only' is selected, you will get a printout of just the displayed topic; otherwise the entire document will be printed. The text is formatted according to the width of paper selected by your printer driver.

{Topic:What is} {Picture:i,cvlogo}?{F:0}{Rule:0}{Picture:R,Logo}
{Picture:i,cvlogo} is a utility for creating and reading hyper-linked documents. hyper-linking allows the author of a document to mark points in the text which are related to other parts of the document. The reader of the document can follow such references quickly by simply clicking on them with the mouse. This makes it very easy to wander through a document at will, following up interesting trains of thought or ideas, without losing track of the main thread. For most applications, this means that the desired information can be extracted from a document far more quickly, easily and effectively than by more traditional methods.

{Picture:i,cvlogo} is designed specifically to present documents which are mostly text. It is intended to replace a traditional textbook with an electronic equivalent having all the same features and many advantages. The ability to print {Picture:i,cvlogo} documents further extends the flexibility of the system, allowing {Ref:printed,Printing} texts of very high quality to be produced from the material in a {Picture:i,cvlogo} document. Although text is central to the design of {Picture:i,cvlogo}, it is possible to illustrate {Picture:i,cvlogo} documents very easily, even including animations if desired. {Picture:i,cvlogo} undertakes the bulk of the document formatting automatically, leaving authors free to concentrate on the content of their work.

{Picture:i,cvlogo} has many potential applications. Information resources of all sorts may be presented and made more accessible using {Picture:i,cvlogo}. Some typical applications might include:

{>:4}*{>:8}On-line manuals such as this one. {Picture:i,cvlogo} can make creation and distribution of manuals for software quicker, cheaper and more useful to the end-user. Manuals are more easily updated and there is the possibility of interaction with the software.

{>:4}*{>:8}Curriculum resources may be gathered together and presented to pupils in an easily accessible form using {Picture:i,cvlogo}. Pupils are encouraged to explore the information in their own way by following references which interest them.

{>:4}*{>:8}Technical information which is subject to frequent change can be presented in a useful format without compromising the ability to provide regular updates. The Archimedes Virus Reference Document is a good example of this.

{>:4}*{>:8}Complex information being distributed to users with a widely varying level of knowledge is ideally handled by a hyper-linked document. A compact overview can contain references to more detailed explanations of difficult areas, allowing experienced users to gain all the information they need quickly, while those with less knowledge will have no difficulty in finding what they need to know.

{>:4}*{>:8}On-line services can use {Picture:i,cvlogo} documents to provide information containing combinations of text and pictures in one simple file format. Users can download one copy of the {Picture:i,cvlogo} reader allowing them access to easily downloaded {Picture:i,cvlogo} files.

{>:4}*{>:8}Almost any information which might be provided in a book can more usefully be provided in a {Picture:i,cvlogo} file.

In addition to creating, displaying and browsing your own resources there is an ever expanding range of ready-made {Picture:i,cvlogo} files on subjects ranging from European Demographics to fully cross-referenced editions of Shakespeare plays.

{F:00000000000001
{topic:Searching}{F:0}{Rule:0}{Picture:R,Logo}
The text may be searched for direct access to any of the cross reference points (including topic names) or for any particular sequence of characters. To start a search, choose the Search option from the {Ref:Tools menu,Tools Menu} or click {B:SEL} over the search icon in the {Ref:toolbox,Toolbox Commands} (The search icon looks like this: {Picture:I,find} ).

{F:2}Finding Cross References{F:0}{Index:Goto/Search}
The Search Text dialogue box will appear when the tool is selected. This is divided into two parts. The top part shows a list of all cross reference points in the text. You may scroll through this list and click {B:SEL} to select any item and then click the {B:Goto} icon to see the part of the text referred to. As a short-cut, double-click {B:SEL} over the entry in the list.

{F:2}Searching For Text{F:0}{Index:Search Text}
The lower part of the dialogue box allows the text to be searched for any word or words. Type some text into the first writeable icon and click the {B:OK} icon to search for it. Note that it does not matter if the text is in upper or lower case (or mixed). The first occurrence of the text will be displayed in the document window, or a message will appear if the text could not be found.

{F:2}Refining the Search{F:0}{Index:Near Icon}{Index:Or Icon}
You may enter text into both the writable icons for a search. In this case, you may select the Or icon or the Near icon between the two pieces of text. If the Or icon is selected, the search will locate any point in the text where either of the entries appears. If the Near icon is selected, the search will only locate points where both entries appear near each other in the text. As an example this could be used to search for SEARCH near TEXT to find out about searching for text without finding all the references to searching and to text.

{F:2}Finding Multiple Occurrences{F:0}{Index:Next Match}
Once the text has been found, you may wish to search for the next place in the document where the same text appears. To do this, select the Next Match icon in the Search Text dialogue before starting the search. The search will then start from the current point instead of from the beginning.

To create and use bookmarks, choose the Bookmark option from the {Ref:Tools menu,Tools Menu} or click {B:SEL} over the bookmark icon in the {Ref:toolbox,Toolbox Commands} (the bookmark icon looks like this: {Picture:I,mark} ).

{F:2}Using a Bookmark{F:0}{Index:Goto/Bookmark}
The Bookmarks dialogue box will appear when the tool is selected. This is divided into two parts. The top part shows a list of all bookmarks currently set in the text. You may click {B:SEL} to select any of them and then click the {B:Goto} icon to see the part of the text referred to. As a short-cut, double-click {B:SEL} over the entry in the list.

{F:2}Maintaining Bookmarks{F:0}
When any bookmark is selected, you can click the {B:Delete} icon to remove it from the list. This will occur immediately and without warning, so be careful! To create a new bookmark, type the name you wish to give the bookmark into the writable icon in the lower part of the dialogue box. When the name is correct, click the {B:Create} icon and a new bookmark will be created referring to the currently displayed section of text. Note that the mark actually refers to the first word visible in the window and this will be positioned at the top of the window when the bookmark is selected in the future. This may result in a slightly different view of the text if the window is a different width at the time.

The Evaluation (E) version is a working copy of the software and may be used to read documents. However, it has no {Ref:printing,Printing} or {ref:saving,Saving} facilities and has some restrictions in other areas. If you run into any of these restrictions, a message will appear to say what has happened.

The Standard (S) version has no restrictions and is able to save documents and to print them. This is the version most people are expected to use, but it has no facilities for creating new documents.

The Advanced (A) version is similar to the standard version but includes a sophisticated compiler allowing hyper-linked documents to be created easily from text, sprite and draw files.
